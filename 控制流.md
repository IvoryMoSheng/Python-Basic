# 控制流
# if语句
if语句用来检验一个条件， 如果条件为真，我们运行一块语句（称为 if-块），否则处理另外一块语句（称为 else-块）。else从句是可选的。


	输入
	number = 23
	guess = int(raw_input('Enter an integer : '))
	if guess == number:
	print 'Congratulations, you guessed it.' # New block starts here
	print "(but you do not win any prizes!)" # New block ends here
	elif guess < number:
	print 'No, it is a little higher than that' # Another block
	# You can do whatever you want in a block ...
	else:
	print 'No, it is a little lower than that'
	# you must have guess > number to reach here
	print 'Done'
	# This last statement is always executed, after the if statement is executed
